            <h3>Reviewing IT deveopment tools</h3>
            <p>
                  The current generation of IT development tools can be combined to give an excellent environment for producing software. Codepen provides examples that can be incorporated into your own projects, trello offers an organisational environment for planing and visual studio acts as a sophisticated word processor that understands the syntax of many programming languages.

            <h3>Describing Selected tools</h3>
            <p>
                  Software tools are a means to an end and that end is increasing productivity.With this goal in mind it is clear that the suite of tools used in this project was highly effective. In trello you can store links to research documents for ease of use and a dedicated word processor for software development vastly increases productivity

            <h3>Assesing final project</h3>
            <p>
                  I am happy with this website because it is simple but effective. However it could be improved with a more sophisticate navigation system.

            <h3>Further Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                  I would improve my blog by adding a cv page to market myself .Also I would put in a technical review for evaluating programming languages .Functionality could be improved by dividing content into smaller sub sections which could be accessed with a navigation bar.

            <h3>Benefits and drawbacks of development tools</h3>
            <p>
                  Although software tools are beneficial they have somer drawbacks. The main one is that they can become an end in themselves and updating a repository becomes an obligation.Also it can reduce face to face communication which may lead to valuable insights being lost.But overall in this project the ease of use outweighed the these considerations.Storing research documents in trello was helpful and the development environment vastly improved code writing efficiency.

            <h3>Productivity Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                  The boundaries of productivity and efficiency are constantly being pushed back in the IT industry . Setting clear goals at the start of a project is vital.These should be specific measurable attainable relevant and time bound. A good understanding of existing tools can be developed with training and practice which can dramatically impact productivity

            <h3>Describe Productivity Improvements</h3>
            <p>
                  Developing solutions to improve productivity while a project is underway could  be detrimental to project  development if it is not fully integrated into the  development process.This would be more achievable in agile environment which is better able to handle continuous feedback.

            <h3>Testing Digital Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                  There are two types of testing of an It system unit testing and user testing.Unit testing is making sure that the technical aspects of a system work properly .All functionality must behave expected e.g buttons and links must perform as intended .To do this it is necessary to have a system diagram that can be checked.User testing is far more subjective because it can involve intangibles such as colour. To do this market research is conducted with a test group and feedback is monitored .
