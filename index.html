            <h3>Why I Came To Code Nation </h3>
            <p>
                        I was looking to gain a qualification to enhance my programming skills.
                        As I am predominately self taught in programming the document object model with javascript I felt that I needed to obtain some evidence and have my skills verified by a reputable company.
                        Code Nation offers courses where you can obtain level 2 certification in coding and cyber security

            <h3>Why I Like Coding</h3>
            <p>
                        I have a genuine enthusiasm for software development  as I actually enjoy the process of code creation particularly creating computer graphics .
                        Technological change appears to be accelerating across many different areas of computing.This offers many opportunities for someone who is highly skilled and motivated.Therefore I hope to take advantage of these

            <h3>Purpose of IT</h3>
            <p>
                        At the centre of any modern business system is the database.Original storage and  retrieval functions have now been augmented  with a suite of analytical 
                        tools.
                         Databases are orientated towards the internal data of a business and and also towards markets and potential customers

           <h3>Methods, Skills and Resources</h3>
            <p>
                        Your hardware must be sufficiently up to date with processors that are fast and powerful enough to run modern software applications .The most essential skills for managing a project are leadership, communication, planning time management, risk management and  negotiation.
                        The system itself must incorporate excellent design principles particularly in user experience and database design

            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>
                  For planning this project I used the tool trello which is an online implementation of the japanese kanban system.I was able to incorporate my research into this system with many links stored under the various subsections .Here is a link to my <a href=" https://trello.com/b/E5daklVs/blog">trello board</a>

            <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                        The five most common threats to the successful completion of an IT project according to the book Waltzing with bears by tom demarco and tim lister are as follow
            </p>       
                  <ul>       
                     <li> software is inherently difficult to estimate and schedule</li>
                     <li> as projects develop features tend to get inflated</li>
                     <li> employee turnover</li>
                     <li>a lack of understanding of what a specification actually means</li>
                     <li> long project times leading to low productivity</li>
                  </ul>

            <h3>IT Procurement</h3>
            <p>
                        After researching different types of IT systems I was able to isolate some general principles that would be useful as rules of thumb for procuring a new IT system .
                        The first is what do you sell if your products need real time tracking and despatch coupled with amount of orders you process.
                        Staff training considerations and future expansion are fundamental considerations .How much feedback reporting does your management team need .
                        The system itself needs to be assessed in terms of budget and availability of back up services.

      <div>
            <h3>Analyse Choices</h3>
            <p>
                  My choices of tools for this project are codepen for code examples, trello for planning and the visual studio integrated development environment.I didn't really encounter many problems with these choices.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div>
            <h3>Legalities</h3>
            
            <p>
                        The GDPR regulations of the European union extends the definition of personal data to genetic and biometric data and also system generated data which can identify a n individual .This includes IP addresses,RFID tags and mac addresses.Privacy by design is the principle which can help facilitate this and it is codified in the privacy impact statement which is required for any IT project and covers these areas of project development
            </p>      
             <ul>     
                   <li>data collection and retention</li>
                   <li>technical 7 security measures</li>
                   <li>subject access rights</li>
                   <li>risk assessment</li>
                   <li>training and professional development</li>
            </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
            <h3>Content Layout</h3>
            <p>
                  I decided to go for a very simple scrolling layout with two pages of content.By using a strong colour scheme enhanced by a dark on  background I felt I could lay it out in the most simple way possible .
            </p>
            <p>
                  The review section needed to be on  a separate page for to keep continuity of the content.
            </p>
      </div>
      <div>
            <h3>Copyright Considerations</h3>
            <p>
                        Web developers mustn't neglect copyright considerations that may affect a website that they create.Most importantly developers must ensure that any content that is provided by a client must be owned by them. By default the copyright of a website is owned by the developer and this right can be used as leverage to ensure payment

            <h3>Access Issues</h3>
            <p>
                        Website need to be accessed by all potential users so impairments of vision hearing and motor functions,sensitivity to light and cognitive disabilities need to be taken into consideration.Below are the main recommendations of the web accessibility initiative
                        
            </p>

             <ul>
                   <li>keyboard friendly.Can be navigated without a mouse</li>
                   <li> make content easily accessible </li>
                    <li> use of headers and ARIA landmarks  </li> 
                    <li> clearly label dynamic content for screen readers</li>
                   <li>choose colors carefully avoid palettes with similar hue's and saturation</li>
                   <li>clearly label forms </li>
                    <li>re sizable text</li>
                   
             </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
            <h3>Filetypes</h3>
            <p>
                  The most commonly used file types used in websites are  html files which are the containers that content is stored in.These containers are commonly refereed to as elements.CSS files which contain code that determines the style or look of the html elements and javascript files that which enables dynamic interaction between the html elements.

 
            </p>
               
            <p>
                  Websites can also serve up videos, advertisements and images which also have there own formats .For video the most popular format is mp4 and an open source format webM still has problems gaining traction.Images are best stored in  a jpeg because it is compressed.
